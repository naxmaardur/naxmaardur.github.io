                    In this project I was responsible for the Atmospheric Design, throughout the development of Everlasting I changed and tweaked many different things, such as different textures for the eyes that look at the player, sound and the level of darkness, to make the experience give the feeling that we intended.
                	A major change to the atmosphere of the game was the addition of rain, it originally came as a suggestion and was then added to the game, this gave the desired effect but made the end of the game less impactful, for that reason, the rain reduces until it's fully gone making the final track through the darkness very silent. This silence did not give the desired effect but because of time constraints, I could not tweak it further.

                <h2>Story and mechanics</h2>
                <p>
                    In Everlasting, you play as a young girl who lost her parents in a recent landslide, she is trying to record everything that is important to her while climbing her way up to the lighthouse of this small village.
                    On her way there she encounters different supernatural creatures and a friendly cat that guids her to the lighthouse.
                    <br>
                    The game features two main mechanics<br>
                    Taking pictures using the camera to record the happenings of the game<br>
                    And a "sanity" system which makes your character panic more and more the longer you are in the darkness leading. This is represented by slightly warping the screen, making eyes look at you from the darkness and fully changing the audio that you hear.
