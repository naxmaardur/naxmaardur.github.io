                My goal of this project was to create complicated and interesting puzzles with a limited set of mechanics.
                I ended up setteling on the idea to make the player control two characters at the same time that mirror each other's actions, the player than has to solve puzzles on both sides at the same time.
                The other mechanic is a line of sight based system where the characters can take and send energy to points that they are looking at. The complexity of these systems in puzzles comes in when players need to take energy from a spot with one character but not with the other, making it so that they need to find a way to have these spots be in different states.

                The approach I took for creature the puzzles in this game was to build out a level not knowing if it is possible and then try to solve it my self. If I managed to solve it I would make that solution impossible and try again if I was still able to solve it I would let others test it.
                From these tests players sometimes came up with completely new ways to solve the level, depending on how creative the solution I altered to level to make it possible or impossible. When it came to all of these changes I made sure to not make it instantly obvious that those solutions are impossible.
